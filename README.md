# Environments

Just a backup of my environment configurations for various situations. You may find any number of configuration files in here. Most (if not all) should work. They all worked at one point somewhere. I just don't want to be left reconfiguring my aliases every time I touch a new machine or trying to remember just how I had `insert system` setup.
